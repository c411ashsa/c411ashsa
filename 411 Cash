Make interest payments while you’re still in school. If you have the means, getting a jumpstart before you graduate can help ease your loan burden later on.
Automate payments. Setting up your student loan payments to automatically come out of your checking account each month can help ensure that you don’t forget to pay. This will help protect you from paying late fees as well as keep your credit healthy since late payments can have a negative impact.
