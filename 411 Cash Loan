Know your loan options. There are several federal student loan repayment options including ones that allow you to pay less during lower-earning periods, or that extend the loan term in order to lower the monthly payment. These options may be helpful if you are struggling to make payments, but be aware that they can result in paying more over the life of the loan. For private loans, if you have issues affording payments, get in touch with the loan servicer to discuss your options.
Use your (possible) tax refund: If you are working and qualify for a tax refund, that could be a good source of extra cash to put toward your student loan repayment.
