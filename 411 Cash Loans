411 Cash Loans

Taking out a student loan—with or without parents—is a big decision with long-term financial implications. If you’re borrowing on your own, you will be obligated to make repayments and your credit alone will be impacted. The advantage is that you will have full control of your finances and not be beholden to another person. Consistent on-time payments can help build your credit, unlike a parent loan that isn’t in your name. For private loans, if you do end up with a co-signer that is not your parent, be aware that the person is legally responsible, so you will be damaging their credit, and possibly your relationship with them, if you miss payments.
